## Design

Juniper draws its palette and mood from the forest floor — deep shadows, muted evergreen tones, and the kind of stillness that makes you slow down and read. The aesthetic is intentional:

- **Forest-dark color palette** — rich near-black backgrounds offset by muted greens and warm neutrals
- **Ambient background** — a slow, living backdrop that shifts like light through a canopy
- **Organic texture** — a hero image that grounds the page in something natural, not synthetic
- **Minimal chrome** — no noise, no gradients fighting for attention; the content breathes

---

## What's included

- **Hero** — headline, subhead, and social links
- **About** — personal bio and summary
- **Experience** — chronological work history with company, role, and highlights
- **Blog** — card grid of articles with individual post pages at `/blog/[slug]`
- **Scroll animations** — CSS-driven reveal system via Intersection Observer, no animation library required
- **SEO-ready** — server-side rendering, Metadata API, statically generated blog pages, optimized images

## Customization

All content lives in one file:

export const education = [...]   // Education
```

The theme — colors, typography, dark mode — is in **`app/theme.ts`**.
